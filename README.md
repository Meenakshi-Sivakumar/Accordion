## Description

Internet Accordion is a creative and interactive accordion web page built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows you to create expandable and collapsible sections on your web pages. This project is one of my hobby projects, designed to showcase my creativity and skills in web development.

## Live Demo

## Usage

To use the Internet Accordion, simply download the project files from this GitHub repository. You can then import the `Accordion` component into your own React projects and customize it according to your needs.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Accordion from './Accordion';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Web Page</h1>
      <Accordion title="Section 1" content="Content for section 1" />
      <Accordion title="Section 2" content="Content for section 2" />
      {/* Add more accordion sections as needed */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
